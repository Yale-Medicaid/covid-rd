#### Data Sources
This paper primarily uses restricted mortality data provided by the [Covid-19 Research Database](https://covid19researchdatabase.org/).
These data may be obtained by registering with the research database and requesting access to the *Mortality Database*. The raw data must then be queried from their database.

We also use publicly available mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
As these data are continually updated we have provided the file we used as of the time of publication within this replication package.
Updated versions of the [Weekly Counts of Deaths by Jurisdiction and Age](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Counts-of-Deaths-by-Jurisdiction-and-Age/y5bj-9g5w) are found through the link.
